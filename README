Code for Critical Practices project three.

To install:
   `npm install`
To run:
   `npm start`

This project runs inside of an Electron application. The entry point
is `main.js`. `./images` contains some sample images of faces
extracted from webcam images using the included Mathematica script.

This project also contains a couple of different scripts for
extracting faces from images. In order to use them you'll need to have
openCV installed. I beleive that just running `pip install
opencv-python` should do it.

Running on the PI
-----------------

To run this code on our PI checkout the `PI` branch. Once you've done
that you'll need to switch to the `cv` virtual enviroment by running:

     `source ~/.profile`
     `workon cv`
