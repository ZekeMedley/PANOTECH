Based on an article [1] on realtime webcam processing, I want to try
to seperate the processing of frames and the retreiving of them. This
is based on the observation that if we just collect frames and
instantly display them in opencv it looks very realtime.

On the main thread I'll collect frames from the webcam and push them
into a work queue. Threads will pop items from the work queue and push
them to the render queue. The main thread will also render frames in
the render queue.

To compile:

clang++ $(pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4) -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main -Ofast -march=native -Wall -Wextra
